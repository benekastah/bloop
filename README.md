Blâˆžp: A toy language with Hindley-Milner style type inference

This is a toy language with basic type checking. It does not yet compile to anything useful, but the type checking seems to work reliably. Thanks a lot to Andrew Forrest for [this article](https://dysphoria.net/2009/06/28/hindley-milner-type-inference-in-scala/) which provided a Scala implementation of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. I don't think I ever would have wrapped my head around it without that, and my verifier.js file is basically a port of it.
